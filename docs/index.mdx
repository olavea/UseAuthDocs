# useAuth
## – the simplest way to add authentication to your React app
### How to use useAuth
***
useAuth is designed to be quick to setup. You'll need an Auth0 account with an app domain and client id.


## 1. How Do I Install useAuth?



```
$ yarn add react-use-auth
or
$ npm i react-use-auth
```


Downloads from npm, adds to your package.json, etc. You can use npm as well.



## 2. Set up AuthProvider
useAuth uses an AuthProvider component to configure the Auth0 client and share state between components. It's using React context with a reducer behind the scenes, but that's an implementation detail.

I recommend adding this around your root component. In Gatsby that's done in gatsby-browser.js and gatsby-ssr.js. Yes useAuth is built so it doesn't break server-side rendering. ✌️

But of course server-side "you" will always be logged out.




```
// gatsby-browser.js

import React from "react";
import { navigate } from "gatsby";

import { AuthProvider } from "react-use-auth";

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => (
    <AuthProvider
        navigate={navigate}
        auth0_domain="useauth.auth0.com"
        auth0_client_id="GjWNFNOHq1ino7lQNJBwEywa1aYtbIzh"
    >
        {element}
    </AuthProvider>
);
```

```
<AuthProvider>
```
 creates a context, sets up a state reducer, initializes an Auth0 client and so on. Everything you need for authentication to work in your whole app :)

The API takes a couple config options:

1. navigate – your navigation function, used for redirects. I've tested with Gatsby, but anything should work
2. auth0_domain – from your Auth0 app
auth0_client_id – from your Auth0 app
auth0_params – an object that lets you overwrite any of the default Auth0 client parameters
PS: even though Auth doesn't do anything server-side, useAuth will throw errors during build, if its context doesn't exist

### Default Auth0 params
By default useAuth's Auth0 client uses these params:

```
const params = {
    domain: auth0_domain,
    clientID: auth0_client_id,
    redirectUri: `${callback_domain}/auth0_callback`,
    audience: `https://${auth0_domain}/api/v2/`,
    responseType: "token id_token",
    scope: "openid profile email"
};
```

domain and clientID come from your props.

redirectUri is set to use the auth0_callback page on the current domain. Auth0 redirects here after users login so you can set cookies and stuff. useAuth will handle this for you ✌️

audience is set to use api/v2. I know this is necessary but honestly have been copypasting it through several of my projects.

responseType same here. I copy paste this from old projects so I figured it's a good default.

scope you need openid for social logins and to be able to fetch user profiles after authentication. Profile and Email too. You can add more via the auth0_params override.
